npm is node package manager


we started off by creating a main directory called TDD, then specs folder.
then we created taxi.js and taxi_specs.js
we then go to package.json and change the test field to mocha specs.
we also initialise npm by doing npm init then enter enter enter many times then yes
then npm i -D mocha

we then run npm test in the terminal to get it started
