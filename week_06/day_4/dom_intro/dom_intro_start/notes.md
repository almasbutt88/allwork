this is dom stuff, document object model = DOM

model of html page translated into object

browser turns all things in html into javascript objects so we can
interact with those objects in the browser using JS (linked as js/app.js)

usually the browser requests the index.html and the js app and css from the server

a node tree  - an upside down tree. Nodes are like objects

document is the entire document
then html

then body h1, image, titles etc. Traversing the dom **

manipulating the dom is a js devs job

typing document shows you the document node


to start off
we need index.html

this contains an unordered list of blue green red with css classes attached

ID of welcome-paragrapho

css/styles.css in a <link>
