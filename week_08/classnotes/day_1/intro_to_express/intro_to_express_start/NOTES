const [message, setMessage] = useState(''); //we are setting the message here because we are using it in the P tag
  useEffect(()=> {

  .then(response => response.json) //convert to json
  // .then (data => console.log(data)); instead of this, lets do this instead
  .then(response => setMessage(response.message)); // this is coming from server.js line 20.
  
  })
